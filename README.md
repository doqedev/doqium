# !!bad code!!
decided to set the github to public so like here u go

this was made a year ago where like i didnt know anything about webdesign or backend that much

# doqium

this used to be a web executor for a ROBLOX game, but now it is a remote admin with it's own global ban system, web panel, script flag, etc!

# How To Host

## Clone The Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doqedev/doqium.git
